# XKCD newtab

This is a very simple firefox (though it should work in chrome without any drama) addon I hacked together in an hour while procrastinating from homework. I don't care for the default firefox newtab page and enjoy XKCD but rarely think to actually visit it. Two birds with one stone or something to that effect.

[You can view the addon and get it here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xkcd-newtab/). I just need to make a couple of small changes to get it approved for chrome and I'll be doing that "at some point" 

Feature requests are likely to mostly be ignored.
