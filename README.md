# XKCD newtab

This is a very simple firefox (though it should work in chrome without any drama) addon I hacked together in an hour while procrastinating from homework. I don't care for the default firefox newtab page and enjoy XKCD but rarely think to actually visit it. Two birds with one stone or something to that effect.

Feature requests are likely to mostly be ignored.
